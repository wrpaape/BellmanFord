    I wrote up a test C++ program which parses a text file and builds a graph
organized in memory as an adjacency list.  The program accepts a "start" and
"target" node, and leverages Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate and then display
the shortest path from start to target.

    I spent 90 minutes browsing through the remainder of the intro.pdf pages
not covered in the first lecture.  I encountered instances on several pages
where I wasn't clear or had incomplete information, but these were of a form
that suggest that the remaining information will be provided while covering the
page in lecture (i.e. reflective questions).  I have taken note of these
unclear sections (slide 16, the question on slide 31, etc...) and will hold
back on asking for clarification until they have been covered in lecture.
